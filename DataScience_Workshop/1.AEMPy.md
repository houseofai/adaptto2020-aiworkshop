AdaptTo() 2020 - Workshop 2nd part
======


1.) Data Science in AEM using Python with AEMpy
------

**Description**: This part of the workshop's objective is to get familiar with AEMpy, the python library for AEM. We use a Docker image, so you don't have to install Python, Jupyter, AEM, and all the necessary libraries.

We will connect to an AEM instance using AEMpy, and analyze the error.log file with a popular Data Science Python library: pandas.

**Please make sure you have been through the prerequisites before running the code.**

**For the prerequisites, see file 0.Prerequisites.md**

### 1.1) Launch the workshop Docker image

Use the `docker run` command to launch the image:
```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 4502:4502 -it --rm odyssee/adapt_aempy bash
```
*Note: The parameter -p map the port 8888 (Jupyter server) to your localhost. I let you bet what the port 4502 used for is :)*

### 1.2) Launch Jupyter server and AEM

And run the start script to launch the Jupyter Notebook and AEM in a background task:
```
sh ./start.sh
```

### 1.3) Star coding

1. Start Python by typing in your terminal:
```
$ python
```

2. Once in the python interpreter:
```
# Import AEMpy library
import aempy
```

3. Connect and display the AEM version
```
# Connect to the AEM Instance
instance = aempy.AEM()
```
```
# Get the product information
productinfo = instance.info()
```
```
# Print the product version
print(productinfo.version)
```

4. Get the error logs
```
# Connect to the system console
system = aempy.System()
```
```
# Get the five first lines of the error.log file
errorlogs = system.log_error(5)
```
```
# Print the lines
print(errorlogs)
```

5. Parse the logs
```
# Let's get more line from error.log (default: 10.000 lines)
errorlogs = system.log_error()
```
We import a new library named **pandas** (it has nothing to do with the animal).
Pandas is a Data analysis and manipulation library, mainly using a data frame.
```
# Import Pandas library
import pandas as pd
```
 *Note: It is an excellent practice to have all the imports at the beginning of your python program. But for the comprehension of this tutorial, we added it here.*
```
# Split the logs and arrange in a table using the Pandas library
dfLog = pd.DataFrame([sub.split(" ") for sub in errorlogs])
```
```
# Add Names to the columns
dfLog = dfLog.rename(columns={0:'date',1:'time',2:'level',3:'ID',4:'class',5:'msg'})
```
```
# Print the parsed logs
print(dfLog)
```

6. Convert logs to a pandas Dataframe
```
# There is a builtin parsing in AEMpy to automatically convert logs to pandas data frame
dfErrors = system.error_log_to_df(errorlogs)
```
```
# Print the first 10 lines of the pandas dataframe
print(dfErrors.head())
```
```
# Ask pandas to describe the dataframe
print(dfErrors.describe())
```

7. Analyze the logs with the *ERROR* level
```
# Filter the logs by level
dfLevelError = dfErrors[dfErrors["level"].str.match("ERROR")]
# Add a title for the next actions
print("Information about log errors:")
```
```
# Display the first 5 lines of the dataframe
print(dfLevelError.head())
```
```
# Display the last 5 lines of the dataframe
print(dfLevelError.tail())
```
```
# Describe the table
print(dfLevelError.describe())
```
At this point, we have analyzed the error logs using a raw solution (without pandas) and parsed solution (with pandas) that gives us the possibility to do more in-depth analysis.
There are two problems when using the python interpreter:
 - Once you have quit the interpreter, all your context is lost
 - You can not visualize your data. Visualization and plotting your data helps a lot to understand it.
